This is the web crawler, scraper that I made for the Drexel carrer center's job listings. The crawler navigates all the pages and gets the source using Python and Selenium. The scraper then takes the source and goes through the source and gets the required data i.e. job designation, description, location etc. using Python and Beautiful Soup. 
The final result is a CSV file which is then put in a SQLite database using Python and SQLITE3 module. I then run different analytics on the data gathered like the calculating term frequency for diffrent skills in the job descriptions and the grouping the jobs by location.
