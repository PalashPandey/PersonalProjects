Today attribution of malware and cyberattacks is difficult and often impossible.

At the same time Source code authorship attribution is a significant privacy threat to anonymous code contributors. We plan to take advantage of recent breakthroughs made by our team in attributing code and binaries to programmers. These breakthroughs stem from the realization that individual programmer style can often be captured in the structures programmers use via the Abstract Syntax Tree which can be represented in feature vectors and then used by classification algorithms such as random forests. Including these features allows us to improve the accuracy and scale of attribution approaches by an order of magnitude.
