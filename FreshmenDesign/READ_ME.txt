This is my freshmen design pproject. My team made an eductional tool for abstract algebra, specifically Group theory and graph theory. 
We created the grouping algorithm ourselves and we are using Vis.js for the node graphs and W3.css for front-end design. We are also using Intro.js for the walkthrough.
